## Quiz-App For Android Basics Udacity Course

### Harry Potter Quiz

For the final project for the Udacity Grow with Google Scholarship Challenge I built a Harry Potter quiz app. 
Each question is about a different horcrux, and I tried to incorporate as many of the different view groups and buttons from class as I could. 
Most questions have radio buttons, but I did add one set of checkboxes for a question with more than one right answer and added appropriate java logic to check the user's answers. I also used a number increment/decrement feature from the JustJava app for some variety.
