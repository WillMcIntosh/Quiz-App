## Quiz-App For Android Basics Udacity Course

### Harry Potter Quiz

For the Quiz App project for the Udacity Grow with Google Android Basics nanodegree I built a Harry Potter quiz app. 
Each question is about a different horcrux, and I tried to incorporate as many of the different view groups and buttons from class as possible. 

Most questions have radio buttons, but I did add one set of checkboxes for a question with more than one right answer and added appropriate logic to check the user's answers. Question seven is a text entry question with logic to format the user's input and check against the correct answer. I also used a number increment/decrement feature from the JustJava app for some variety.
